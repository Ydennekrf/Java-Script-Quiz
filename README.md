# Fundemental JavaScrit Quiz

## Description

 This repository creates a web application, that generates a quiz besed on the the questions provided within the questions array of objects. 
 Upon load up the application only shows the highscore table that if you have previously played games the scores will render on the screen.
 When the start button is pressed you are presented with the first question and the timer begins to count down.
A correct answer will add 1 to your score 10 seconds to the time clock and create a short animation verifying your answer was correct.
A wrong answer will remove 10 seconds from the clock and creates a different animation for verification.
After all questions are completed the game board will disappear and a prompt will ask you to enter your initials and a banner will show up that states your final score and your initials.
if your score is high enough it will get placed on the highscore board in the appropriate place.
 I had a great time creating this code frame work, it was a rewarding yet challenging task that allowed me to improve many of my skills with javascript html and css.
 I believe this application to be in line for some additional features in the future. such as, instead of a prompt a modal would appear asking to enter your initials, mobile support, user input for the questions asked and multiplayer support.
